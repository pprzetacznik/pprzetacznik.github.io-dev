# Why to run your team with Scrum?

## Criticism of Scrum

Many times when discussing organization of teams, especially with developers, I hear responses such as _Well, I don't really scrum, it didn't work for us_. I was trying to get deeper into arguments standing behind that reasoning and some of arguments were:

* _Scrum has never been implemented properly_,
* _Scrum is too strict, there are too many meetings_,
* _Scrum Master is another manager_,
* _We're just getting things done and scrum is just slowing us down_.

In this post I would like to point few arguments why Scrum could be the best option for your team at the very beginning.

## Key objectives

When choosing an initial framework we first need to answer few questions about the future goals of our team. Most of the time these goals are oriented around some of these key objectives.

* Team building,
* Team resiliency,
* Knowledge sharing,
* Doing research,
* Delivery,
* Documentation,
* Creation of future processes.

My point is that, we could be discussing on these topics for long weeks and we still wouldn't get to the agreement how exactly our process should look like to satisfy these requirements. Instead, when launching the team, we can make a following trade. Let's start with Scrum as this framework is the most commonly known and described framework, and let's fit it to our purpose over time. I'll try to show in later paragraphs why this that's not a bad idea.

## Role of Scrum Master

Probably the biggest controvertions arise when it comes to the responsibilities of Scrum Master. The management demangs from Scrum Master that the team will deliver things faster. On the other hand, the team asks Scrum Master technical questions about stories implementation or requirements specification, when none of these things are in fact Scrum Master's job.

The thing is, Scrum Master is not a job but a role. And you can't fire a role. But when you don't have a full time Scrum Master, someone has to play that role in your time anyway. So what are main responsibilites of Scrum Master?

First of all, Scrum Master is a person responsible for process management. They're so called **horizontal manager**, therefore Scrum Master is not a line manager and they don't push developers to implement one more thing, but rather they're telling them what the current process is. The proces, the whole team has agreed on, but we'll get to that later.

* Delivery vs team work
* Assertiveness

##  Team as the smallest organizational unit

* Bus factor

## Scrum vs Kanban

## Story points

* Focus on team velocity rather than the velocity of individual contributors

## Retrospectives

* Framework can be changed over time
* Feedback
