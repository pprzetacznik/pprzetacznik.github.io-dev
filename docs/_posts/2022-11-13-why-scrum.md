# Why to run your team with Scrum?

## Criticism of Scrum

Many times when discussing organization of teams, especially with developers, I hear responses such as _Well, I don't really like scrum, it didn't work for us_. I was trying to get deeper into arguments standing behind that reasoning and some of arguments were:

* _Scrum has never been implemented properly_,
* _Scrum is too strict, there are too many meetings_,
* _Scrum Master is another manager_,
* _We're just getting things done and scrum is just slowing us down_.

In this post I would like to point few arguments why Scrum could be the best option for your team at the very beginning.

## Key objectives

When choosing an initial framework we first need to answer few questions about the future goals of our team. Some of these key points are listed below.

* Team building,
* Team resiliency,
* Knowledge sharing,
* Doing research,
* Delivery,
* Documentation,
* Creation of future processes.

My opinion is that, we could be discussing on these topics for long weeks and we still wouldn't get to the agreement how exactly our process should look like to satisfy these requirements. Instead, when launching the team, we can make a following trade. Let's start with Scrum as this framework is the most commonly known and described framework, and let's fit it to our needs over time. I'll try to show in later paragraphs why this that's not a bad idea.

## Role of Scrum Master

Probably the biggest controvertions arise when it comes to the responsibilities of Scrum Master. The management demangs from Scrum Master that the team will deliver things faster. On the other hand, the team asks Scrum Master technical questions about stories implementation or requirements specification, when none of these things are in fact Scrum Master's job.

The thing is, Scrum Master is not a job but a role. And you can't fire a role. But when you don't have a full time Scrum Master, someone has to play that role in your team anyway. So what are these responsibilites of Scrum Master?

Foremost, Scrum Master is a person responsible for process management. They're so called **horizontal manager**, therefore Scrum Master is not a line manager and they don't push developers to work faster, but rather they're telling them what the current process is. The process, the whole team has agreed on, but we'll get to that later.

## Team resiliency

So what process management means in practice besides running scrum meetings? In my opinion, the hardest part of the job is the famous **art of saying no**. There is always that developer who says "I'm not proficient with this task, if I could get that task I did 100 times and my collegue will do the task they did 100 of times, we could get that done faster". And there's always that manager who micromanages them and approves that because they gave some commitment to their stakeholders. Well, I'm seeing a great danger when such approach gets through. What we're gaining is a short-term quick deliverables, but what we're losing is a team resiliency. If you don't have a person watching for these things, you can end up with a team of subject matter experts of which everyone is not touching other's people piece of code because it's not their expertise. In extreme cases, when these subject matter experts are starting going on holidays sequentially, you may have whole epics being stuck for months. And I actually have witnessed that in one project right after I joined.

You can see that moderns organizations ephesise an approach where the team is the smallest organizational unit to avoid these situations. And to avoid the pattern of growing *subject matter experts*, they apply the technique called swarming over tickets. That means, there's a huge focus on that all team members knows at least fundamentals of how the whole system works. When someone leaves the team, they need to hand over only the latest story to their teammates. And when someone joins the team, there's a focus to let that person grow by giving them some task from all of the subjects.

So to support team resiliency, Scrum Master needs to be **assertive** and know how to properly **balance between delivery and team work** by reminding the team about the values of team collaboration.

## Scrum Master's role as a coach

I've heard countless of times that Scrum Masters don't know the technical parts of the system and when you ask them for help about technicalites they're avoiding answer by asking you _"Who can give you that answer?"_.

_"Why do I need Scrum Master if they're always asking me during the meeting how to implement the story and writing this on the Confluence?"_

The answer is, that's their job. They should be asking everyone around the table for their opinion and elaborating details of the story to other team members so that everyone feels **invited to the table**. If they would impacting the implementation of the story by telling you what to do they wouldn't be doing their job, and you would need another person moderating the meetings. Otherwise, you may end with a team of individuals who are focus only on their things.

## Story points


* Focus on team velocity rather than the velocity of individual contributors

## Scrum vs Kanban

## Retrospectives

* Framework can be changed over time
* Feedback
