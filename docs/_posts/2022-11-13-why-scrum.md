# Why to start with Scrum?

## Criticism of Scrum

Many times when discussing organization of teams, especially with developers, I hear responses such as _Well, I don't really scrum, it didn't work for us_. I was trying to get deeper into arguments standing behind that reasoning and some of arguments were:

* _Scrum has never been implemented properly_,
* _Scrum is too strict, there are too many meetings_,
* _Scrum Master is another manager_,
* _We're just getting things done and scrum is just slowing us down_.

In this post I would like to point few arguments why Scrum could be the best option for your team at the very beginning.

## Key objectives

* Team building
* Team resiliency
* Delivery
* Documentation
* Creation of processes

##  Team as the smallest organizational unit

* Bus factor
* Role of Scrum Master as a horizontal manager

## Delivery vs team work

* Assertiveness

## Scrum vs Kanban

## Story points

* Focus on team velocity rather than the velocity of individual contributors

## Retrospectives

* Framework can be changed over time
* Feedback
